    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.</p>

  <!-- =============================HOW TO PLAY============================ -->
  <div class="d-flex align-items-center text-white flex-column container mt-5 ">
    <span class="heading-1 text-warning">How to Play Tennis</span>
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">If you’ve been practicing with a friend or tennis coach, and think
      your tennis skills are ready to play a real match, <strong>check out the steps below:</strong></p>
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"> <strong class="text-primary"> Decide who serves first:</strong>A
      coin toss or racket spin is a good way to decide who should serve first. Since the tennis serve is an inherent
      advantage to the player serving, it is only fair to let chance determine who will get to. Once you determine who
      serves, the server only has two opportunities to get the ball in. Should they hit it out, into the net, or step on
      the line while serving, it is considered a fault. Failing to land your second serve will result in a double fault,
      and the loss of the point. </p>
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"><strong class="text-primary">Alternate serving sides:</strong>The
      first serve of each game starts on the right side of the court, also known as the “deuce side” of the court. The
      next point comes from the left side, also known as the “ad court” (short for “advantage”). Serve sides are always
      alternated, and unless you’re doing a second serve, you should never serve from the same side twice in a row.</p>
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"><strong class="text-primary">Use your arsenal: </strong> Whether you
      use your left hand or right hand, your forehand and backhand groundstrokes will be instrumental in winning points,
      along with your serve. Be sure to play to your strengths (for example, if you’re a player whose backhand is
      stronger than their forehand, try to maneuver your footwork around down the middle balls so you can hit more of
      them).</p>
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"><strong class="text-primary">Use your mind:</strong> You’ll have to
      make quick decisions as to which tennis strokes you’re going to use—like whether to stay at the baseline with your
      basic strokes or serve and volley, how much topspin to use, or whether you attempt a winner or try to keep the
      ball in play longer to push the opposing player to make an unforced error.</p>
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"><strong class="text-primary">Change playing sides on the odd
        games:</strong> Having equal conditions for each player contributes to a fair game; this is especially true for
      outdoor courts. The sun and the wind can be major factors when playing tennis, and certain sides of the court may
      be more affected than others. When the sum of the games is an odd number, the players switch sides (for example,
      1-0, 3-2, 5-0, etc.). This means that the players will always switch after the first game, and then after every
      two games after that.</p>

  <!-- ==============================Basic Rules================================ -->
  <div class="d-flex align-items-center text-white flex-column container my-4 ">
    <span class="heading-1 text-warning">What Are the Basic Rules of Tennis?</span>
    <div class="container mb-5">
      <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">Part of learning the basics of tennis involves knowing how to keep
        score. Tennis scoring seems confusing at first but is relatively simple once you get the hang of it. There are
        six games in a set, and most sets are played best out of three (unless it is men’s professional tennis, in which
        case the sets are best out of five). Players must win each set by two games. Here’s how the tennis scoring
        system works:</p>

      <li class="heading-para fs-3 ">
        <strong class="text-danger">The game starts at love.</strong> Each game starts out at 0-0, or “love” increasing
        to <strong>15, then 30</strong> , then 40 for each point scored. For example, if both players each win one point
        in the game, it is 15-15, or 15-all
      </li>
      <li class="heading-para fs-3 "><strong class="text-danger">The server’s score is announced first.</strong> Only
        one player serves per game, and always starts on the right side of the court, alternating sides each point. At
        the end of the game, the players switch turns serving, and on every odd game, they’ll switch the end of the
        court they play on. The server’s score is always announced first (so if the server wins the first point of the
        game and the following point, the score is 30-love)</li>
      <li class="heading-para fs-3 "><strong class="text-danger">Enter the ad-phase.</strong> If each player wins enough
        points to get the score to 40-40 (also known as a deuce or 40-all), they enter the “ad phase.” Since every game
        must be won by two points, one player must score two points in a row. If the server wins the first point after
        the deuce, the score becomes advantage-in (ad-in).</li>
      <li class="heading-para fs-3 "><strong class="text-danger">Win or go back to deuce. </strong> Winning the next
        point wins the game for the server, but losing the point will return the game score back to deuce, in which case
        the server must try to win two consecutive points again.</li>
      <li class="heading-para fs-3 "><strong class="text-danger">Ad-out triggers a must-win situation. </strong> If the
        server loses the first point after deuce, the score becomes advantage-out (ad-out), and they must then win the
        next three points in succession—the first point returns the score to deuce, and then two more points to win the
        game.</li>

      <li class="heading-para fs-3 "><strong class="text-danger">No-ad scoring speeds up the pace.</strong> According to
        the official tennis rules, if you prefer to play a quicker game, “no-ad scoring” is also acceptable. If you and
        the opposing player elect to play that way, 40-40/deuce becomes the game point, so the first person to win the
        next point wins the game.</li>

  <!-- =================================Time Duration============================== -->
  <div class=" text-white container mt-5 ">
    <span class="heading-1 text-warning pb-5">Time Duration Of Game :</span>
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"> On average, a set in tennis will last roughly <strong> 40
        minutes</strong> . However, keep in mind that averages can skew data, and the length of time often varies
      depending on the surface.
