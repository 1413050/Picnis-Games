<p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">Packed with thrills, bumps, sets and spikes, volleyball is a brilliant spectator sport – but it’s even better when you get stuck in yourself. This high-speed game requires athleticism, endurance and power. </p>
<p class=" fs-4 heading-para" align="justify">

    If you’re a beginner, there are plenty of ways to build up your skills and learn how to play volleyball – both indoor and beach. Say goodbye to the sidelines and hello to the adrenaline-packed court with this handy guide. We’ll take you through the basics, cover the key moves to learn and give you top tips on how to develop your prowess on the court.

  <span class="heading-1 text-warning" >What are the basics of volleyball?</span>
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">If you’re thinking about taking up this exhilarating sport or just want to learn more, read through our basic rules on how to play volleyball. From team formations to how to score a point, we’ll help you pick up the essential rules before you get started. </p>

      <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">   An indoor volleyball match is the best of five games. The team who takes the majority (three games) is the overall winner of the match. For beach volleyball, it’s best of three. </p>
        
        <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">   To win a game, a team must score 25 points with a two-point difference. If they’re too closely matched, the game can continue over the 25-point maximum. On the final deciding game of the match it’s only played until 15 points, but the two-point difference still applies. In beach volleyball, a game is played to 21 points, with the same final round and tiebreak rule. You can find out more in our video guide to beach volleyball. </p>
        
          <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">   Each indoor volleyball team consists of six players, whereas beach volleyball is played in teams of two. For indoor volleyball, there are a number of positions. Usually, there are three players at the front near the net and another three towards the back of the court.

<span class="heading-1 text-warning " >How To Play VolleyBall :</span>

    <span class="heading-1" ></span>
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">There are a few ways you can play the ball in volleyball. Here are the main moves you can play to help you get started and understand what you can do to develop your game.
    </p>
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">
        <strong class="text-primary"> Beginners</strong>: When you first start off, it’s a good idea to begin by catching and tossing the ball so to get a feel for the rules while keeping the ball in play for longer. Once you’ve mastered the rules and the flow, it’s time to start bringing hits into the game. For an expert opinion, see what three-time gold medallist Karch Kiraly thinks are the qualities needed for volleyball success.
      </p>
        <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">
        <strong class="text-primary"> Passing: </strong>This is where a player receives the ball from the server and passes it to the playmaker. This is usually done with an underhand bump in a short, controlled manner, with minimal arm swing. It’s quite literally a bump, rather than a hit.
      </p>
        <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">
        <strong class="text-primary"> Setting: </strong>The setter is the playmaker in volleyball. They prepare the ball so it’s well-placed for an attacker to shoot and score a point for their team. Overhead setting is when a player places both their hands above their forehead, creating a triangle shape with their thumbs and index fingers. They push the ball up with their fingers, with the attacker ready to take their shot.
      </p>
        <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">
        <strong class="text-primary"> Spiking: </strong>This is one of the most impressive-looking moves in the game. A spike is generally when a player runs, jumps and hits the ball over the net with a powerful swing. Usually this is a move for an attacker or shooter, as these big hits usually win points. If you’re a beginner, try to avoid spiking until you can maintain a long rally.
      </p>
        <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">
        <strong class="text-primary"> Blocking:</strong> A block is a defensive move used at the net. When an attacker moves to shoot, a maximum of three players on the other team come close to the net and jump just after the attacker with their arms up. When the ball comes over the net, it’ll be blocked by the players and either move into their side or back towards the opposing team.
      </p>
        <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">
        <strong class="text-primary"> Digging: </strong>When the ball is heading towards the floor after an attack, a defender from the back row can run or dive forward to bump the ball back up and pass it to another team member.
      </p>
