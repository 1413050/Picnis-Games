    </span>
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five
      players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a
      basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm)
      in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court, while preventing the opposing
      team from shooting through their own hoop.The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if
      regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.

    <ol>

      <li class="heading-para fs-3  py-2" align="justify"> 
        <strong class="text-primary">Teams :</strong>
        For a full-court game, basketball is played by two teams of five players each.[4] While it's also common to play half-court ball with teams of three, however many people you've got playing, it's important to have an even number of players on each team.

      </li>


      <li class="heading-para fs-3  py-2" align="justify"> 
        <strong class="text-primary">
          Scoring Points :</strong>
          n basketball, an offensive player can score between one and three points with a shot, depending on where the shot is taken on the floor.
          <ul>
            
<li type="disc" class="heading-para fs-3  py-2" align="justify"> 
        Extending in a half-circle, about 20 feet (6.1 m) from the hoop on most courts, should be the "three-point line,".
</li>
      
      <li type="disc" class="heading-para fs-3  py-2" align="justify"> 
        Foul shots are worth one point each and are taken from the free-throw line, which is 15 feet (4.6 m) from the hoop.


      </li>
          </ul>

      </li>


      <li class="heading-para fs-3  py-2" align="justify"> 
        <strong class="text-primary"> Dribbling or Passing :</strong>
        When you have the ball, you have to either be stationary, with one foot planted on the floor to pivot from, or you have to be dribbling the ball, bouncing it up and down on the floor. When you're planted, you can pivot around on one foot, but that foot has to remain planted if you're not dribbling. You can still jump to shoot or pass, but when you come back down you need to have gotten rid of the ball

      </li>


      <li class="heading-para fs-3  py-2" align="justify"> 
        <strong class="text-primary"> Aiming :</strong>
        Get the ball just over the rim of the basket. However, trying to do that might lead to constantly hitting the rim and bouncing back at you. What you really want to do is go cleanly through the center of the rim.

      </li>


      <li class="heading-para fs-3  py-2" align="justify"> 
        <strong class="text-primary"> Winning :</strong>
        Winning a game of basketball is pretty simple; score more points than your opponents in the allotted game time. If the scores are tied at the end then an extra quarter will be played until a winner is found.

      </li>

    <span class="heading-1 text-warning">Rules of the Game
  </div>
  <div class="container mb-5 ">
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">Basketball is a game with something for everyone. It is totally
      inclusive for all shapes, sizes, interests and abilities. Like Other Games Baseketball also contain rules.

    </p>
    <ol>

      <li class="heading-para fs-3  py-2" align="justify"> <strong class="text-primary"> Number of Players : </strong>
        If you want to play basketball for fun, you have the possibility of playing on your own. But you can also play
        team games with either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 players on each teams. Teams can be mixed, with males and females, or
        not.
      </li>

      <li class="heading-para fs-3 py-2 " align="justify"> <strong class="text-primary">Positions :</strong>Each player
        is assigned a position when playing. This position is usually determined by the height of the player.
        <br>
        The tallest player on the team usually plays “center” also known as “position 5”, while the medium size ones
        play “forwards” / “position 3 and 4”. The shortest players then play “guards” / “position 1 and 2”.
      </li>


      <li class="heading-para fs-3  py-2" align="justify"> <strong class="text-primary">Scoring : </strong> A player
        scores when he manages to throw the ball into the basket, with the ball passing through the basket from above
        the hoop.
      </li>
      <li class="heading-para fs-3 py-2 " align="justify"> <strong class="text-primary">Violation :</strong> &nbsp;A
        violation occurs when the player breaks one of the rules of Basketball. A violation results in the awarding of
        the ball to the opponents.

      <li class="heading-para fs-3  py-2" align="justify"> <strong class="text-primary">Fouls :</strong>

        There are two types of fouls. The first are called defensive fouls. They occur when the offensive player is
        being fouled by the defender. Defenders should not block, push, trip, strike or hold the player in possession of
        the ball. The second ones are the offensive fouls. For example, a player in offence commits a foul when charging
        into a stationary defender.
