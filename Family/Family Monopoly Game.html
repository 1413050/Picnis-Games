<ol>



  <li> 
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"><strong class="text-primary fs-4"> Choose a banker : </strong> This player is in charge of all the money, property, houses, and hotels still belonging to the bank. The banker can still play the game, but they should make sure their own money is separate from the bank's.
</li>

  <li> 
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"><strong class="text-primary fs-4"> Pick a game piece : </strong>  Each player gets a game piece to move around the board. The game comes with a large selection, but you can also play with any small object. It does not matter what piece you choose as they all serve the same purpose.
</li>
  
  <li> 
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"><strong class="text-primary fs-4"> Distribution : </strong> Before the game starts, the banker gives everybody their starting money. It should add up to $1500. Most players like to keep their lined up in front of them, but you can store your money any way you want as long as it is in front of you. 
</li>

  <li> 
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"><strong class="text-primary fs-4"> Roll the dice And move the peice : </strong> Each player rolls the dice and moves their game piece the same number of spaces. If you roll doubles, you get to move again after resolving the space you have landed on.
</li>


  <li> 
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"><strong class="text-primary fs-4">  space you landed on: </strong> Monopoly has many different kinds of spaces. Most of them are properties that you can buy or pay rent on, but some of them require you to draw a card from one of two decks, collect money, or even go to jail.
</li>


  <li> 
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"><strong class="text-primary fs-4"> Buy a property: </strong> If you are the first one to land on a spot with a colored stripe across the top, a railroad, or a utility, you may buy the property for the amount printed on the board. The banker in turn gives the player the title deed for that property. Most players recommend buying every property you can as if you don't, the other players have a chance to get it for cheaper.
</li>

  <li> 
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"><strong class="text-primary fs-4"> Collect rent: </strong> If you land on someone else's property, you must pay them the rent printed on the title deed card for that property. </p>
  </li>

  <li> 
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"><strong class="text-primary fs-4"> Buy all one color properties: </strong>  If you own all the properties in a colored group, you have a monopoly! This is one of the main goals of the game--you can bankrupt other players easily if you have a monopoly. Players with a monopoly get to charge double rent for their property on unimproved sites of that color set. </p>
  </li>


  <li> 
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"><strong class="text-primary fs-4"> Turn house to hotel: </strong> If you have a monopoly, you can start to build houses on any of those properties to charge more rent.The most lucrative buildings you can add to your properties are hotels. After you've built four houses on each property, you can buy a hotel from the bank and replace the houses with them. A hotel is roughly equivalent to having five houses yet the maximum number of houses on a site is four. </p>
  </li>


  <li> 
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"><strong class="text-primary fs-4"> Collect 200$: </strong>  Every time a player lands on or passes over the corner space marked "GO," they earn a $200 salary. This is a great way to add a little cash to your reserves</p>
   
  </li>


  <li> 
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"><strong class="text-primary fs-4"> Take a Chance or Community Chest card: </strong> If you land on a spot marked "Chance" or "Community Chest," take the top card off of the corresponding deck of the space that you landed on. These cards have effects that can cause you to earn or lose money, move you across the track or even send you to jail.  </p>
   
  </li>

  <li> 
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"><strong class="text-primary fs-4">Set a time Limit :</strong> If you want a faster game, try setting a timer for 1 or 2 hours. When the timer goes off, each player counts their total amount of money, the printed prices of all their unmortgaged properties, half the prices of all their mortgaged properties, and the printed prices of all houses and hotels. The richest player wins the game!  </p>

    <span class="heading-1 text-warning " > Monopoly Rules:</span>
    <ol>
    <li class="heading-para fs-3 px-5"> When you land on an unowned colored property, railroad, or utility you must either buy it or auction it. </li>


    <li class="heading-para fs-3 px-5">Once you own all the properties within a color set, you can start to build houses on them. You can’t build before this. </li>


    <li class="heading-para fs-3 px-5">The real key to winning a game of Monopoly is in charging other players rent, and causing them to go bankrupt. Here’s a rundown of the rent rules. </li>


    <li class="heading-para fs-3 px-5"> If a player can’t pay the rent they own, they can either try to raise the funds by mortgaging their properties or trading them. If they still can’t raise the necessary funds then they go bankrupt.</li>


    <li class="heading-para fs-3 px-5"> You can mortgage a property you own (including railroads and utilities) at any time. If you do so, you receive half the cost of the property from the bank, but you can’t collect rent on it until it is unmortgaged. </li>
