<span class="heading-1 text-warning" >How did you get into cycling with your family?</span>
<p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">Family cycling is something that both myself and my partner always dreamt of when our two girls were younger. We bought the clip-on Burleys and lived on a remote hill in Scotland with oodles of right to roam tracks available. We lived the dream whilst the kids were tiny and you could scoop them up and pop them into their ‘princess’ carriage.

    Reality kicked in a few years later living in a rural town in England with very few, if any, cycle lanes, an adrenaline-fueled eldest daughter aged 10 who craves challenges (along with her dad) and a younger daughter, aged 7, who fears anything that moves or isn’t flat due to her being hypermobile and dyspraxic, which affects her coordination. For us, the forest forms the perfect traffic-free and calming backdrop for both kids learning to cycle and enjoying carefree days cycling as a family. </p>

    <span class="heading-1 text-warning" >Tips for Balancing Family and Cycling</span>
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">Before I had a kiddo, I would ride 2 hours a day after work and all-day on the weekends.  I laugh about that now.  Thankfully, I know plenty of other parents that can laugh along.

        Recently, my husband was reading me responses to a post in a Facebook group he’s in about balancing family and cycling.  Based on the comments, there is no doubt that raising kids and finding time to ride and/or train is a tricky thing.  That said, if cycling is important to you, then it’s important to find a way to make it all work.  From night riding to bike dates, here are some suggestions on how to balance it all.</p>

<div class="d-flex align-items-center text-white flex-column container my-4 ">
    <span class="heading-1 text-warning" > Teaching your child cycle skills yourself</span>
    <p class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify">
        Strictly speaking, it isn’t essential to have any training to ride a bicycle on the road, inasmuch as it’s not a legal requirement. It is, however, a practical requirement and it should not be overlooked. If you’re unable to arrange training with an accredited National Standard cycle instructor, it’s something you need to take charge of.

        Your child may pick up some skills from you through copying you as you cycle together. Don’t depend on this, though. You will need to check.
        
        The best way to assess cycling ability is to shadow your child on a journey. This is like chaperoning except that you’re not giving instructions and you’re riding directly behind. You’re just there to observe, and to step in if necessary.
        
        You’re looking for a number of key skills. Bike control is probably a given by this point, but before setting out on the road do monitor things like the ability to ride one handed and to ride without veering to one side while looking behind.

    <div class="container">
    <span class="heading-1 text-warning " ></span>
    <li class="heading-para fs-3 px-5"> &nbsp; <strong>Traffic awareness.</strong>  Your child must look behind before changing position on the road and before slowing down. Try holding a certain number of fingers in the air for a few seconds to check if he or she is really looking.  </li>
    <li class="heading-para fs-3 px-5"> &nbsp; <strong>Communication.</strong>  Using eye contact, positioning and signalling, your child needs to be able to communicate intentions clearly to other road users.</li>
    <li class="heading-para fs-3 px-5"> &nbsp; <strong>Junctions.</strong>  Explain who has priority and what the best way is to go through a given junction. Use real-world examples.</li>
    <li class="heading-para fs-3 px-5"> &nbsp; <strong>Positioning.</strong>  Your child might not want to take the lane. It’s easy to get bullied out of doing so by following traffic. You can nevertheless drill in the requirement to ride a good way out of the gutter. </li>
    <li class="heading-para fs-3 px-5"> &nbsp; <strong>Bike awareness.</strong>  Show your child how to check if a bike is roadworthy. Brakes work? Tyres firm enough? Quick releases done up? Nothing loose? Note that ‘roadworthy’ also means lights and a rear reflector at night. You’re not expecting your child to fix any problems, just to alert you if there are any and not to head out the door on an unsafe bike.</li>

  <span class="heading-1 text-warning pb-5" >Time Duration Of Game :</span>
  
  <p  class=" fs-4  heading-para" align="justify"> Make sure it’s a good time of the day for everyone to have fun.  <strong>Mornings work</strong>  best for kids in general but choose a time when everyone is excited about going.

    First rides are best if kept short and sweet making the outcome a positive one, you can increase the duration on the next ride!
